Sale Product set
================

Arthur le 16 décembre 2021
Projet d'un module pour gérer les packs de produits en back office et en caisse
on s'inspire de https://github.com/OCA/pos/blob/9.0/pos_product_template/static/src/js/ppt.js
et de https://github.com/OCA/sale-workflow/blob/14.0/sale_product_set





A **product set** is a list of products which end customers aren't aware, this
list is defined by sales manager.

This module aims to help salesman to quickly create several sale order lines
at once in a quotation.

After a *product set* is added to the sale order, each line can be update or
remove as any other sale order lines.

This is differ to packing products as you don't follow *product set* after it
was added to the sale order.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

* Define a *product set* as sale manager:
    - choose products
    - for each products, define a quantity.
    - Sort *set* lines, this order will be the default when added into the
      quotation

* On quotation any salesman can click on "Add set" button
  which will open wizard where users can chose a *product set* and quantity
  to add at the end of sale order lines. Order defined in *product set* is
  preserved in sale order.
